Hi! I'm Katya, an incoming Applied Math PhD student at Harvard and a Mathematics senior at Princeton. At Princeton, I ran "02.24.2022" student organization and [Momentum 4 Ukraine](https://momentumai.org/momentum4ukraine) tutoring program for Ukrainian refugee students co-founded in response to the war in Ukraine. I am currently interested in topological and geometric machine learning. Previosuly, I pursued interdisciplinary computational research in knot theory, machine learning, astrophysics, language, and music.
