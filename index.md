Hi! I'm Katya, a first-year Applied Math PhD student at Harvard supported by the NSF graduate research fellowship and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Prize fellowship. I have graduated from Princeton with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics in 2023. I am interested in topological and geometric machine learning. Previously, I pursued interdisciplinary computational research in knot theory, machine learning, astrophysics, language, and music.
