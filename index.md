Hi! I'm Katya, a first-generation immigrant in the US and a Mathematics senior at Princeton. On campus, I run "[02.24.2022](http://students4ukraine.com)" student organization and [Momentum 4 Ukraine](https://momentumai.org/momentum4ukraine) tutoring program for Ukrainian refugee students that I co-founded in response to the Russian war in Ukraine. Outside of classes, I do interdisciplinary computational research with applications in knot theory, machine learning, astrophysics, and language.
