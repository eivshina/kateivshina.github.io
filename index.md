Hi! I'm Katya, a second-year Applied Math PhD student at Harvard supported by the NSF graduate research fellowship and the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Prize fellowship. I have graduated from Princeton with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics with honors in 2023. I am interested in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning. Previously, I pursued interdisciplinary computational research in knot theory, machine learning, astrophysics, language, and music.

## PhD admissions

I wrote a guide on STEM Ph.D. admissions in the US that you can purchase [here](https://buy.stripe.com/6oEdSI6ia9FDapG28b). With this guide, you'll be able to access all that you need to craft a strong application for STEM Ph.D. admissions in the United States. The guide walks you through the entire admissions process, including 1) what the admissions committee is looking for; 2) program research (where to apply, funding, contacting potential Ph.D. advisors); 3) application timeline; 4) writing an impactful statement of purpose; 4) requesting recommendation letters; 5) drafting a strong CV; 6) GPA and test score requirements. Filled with practical tips, this guide will help you build a solid Ph.D. application that will set you apart!
