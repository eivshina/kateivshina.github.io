Hi! I'm Katya, an immigrant from Russia and a Mathematics senior at Princeton. On campus, I run ["02.24.2022"](http://students4ukraine.com) student group that I started in response to the war in Ukraine. Outside of classes, I do research in computation & applied math, machine learning, astrophysics, and language.
