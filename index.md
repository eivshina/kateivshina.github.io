Hi! I'm Katya, a first-generation immigrant in the US and a Mathematics senior at Princeton. On campus, I run "[02.24.2022](http://students4ukraine.com)" student organization that I started in response to the war in Ukraine. Outside of classes, I do research in computation & applied math, machine learning, astrophysics, and language.
